# Assignment for Week 3
In this week, we learnt about API, firebase and  backend development. In this assignment, we will be developing the backend of our **Budget Tracker App**.
## Tasks
* Make a **login page** for the app which takes inputs from the users such as *email and password* . After taking the input from the user you will need to pass it on to the Firebase.
* Use Firebase to add the data entered by the user (the category of expense and the amount) to the database , everytime a new entry is made.
* Create a new branch with the name: **RollNumber_IntroToAppDev_Week3(Example: 200040066_IntroToAppDev_Week3)**
* Push your code in the branch you created.
* A Google form will be floated in which you must share the link to the repository and a screen recording of the working application.
