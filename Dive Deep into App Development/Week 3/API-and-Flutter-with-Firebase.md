# Introduction to Backend Developmet:
* In the week 3 of our course, we will dive into the essential concepts of backend development and explore the fundamental role it plays in creating robust and dynamic applications. Backend ensures data storage, processing and its delivery to UI is fast and efficienet.
* Now lets learn more about how databases work. Firestore organizes data into collections, which can contain individual documents. One of the main benifit of firestore is that it integrates well with services like Firebase authentication, cloud storage. Each document consists of a set of key-value pairs, where values can be various types such as strings, numbers, boolean values, arrays, or nested objects. To have more clarity on what is cloud firestore, difference between SQL and NoSQL database and how they work, please have a look on upcoming video: [What is Cloud Firestore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_hR4K4auoQ)

* Now lets dive into one the crucial aspects of Backend Application Programming Interface (API)-

# What is API?
* Application Programming Interface, is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. Here are few important functions that API can perform for App development:
* Access to extrernal services like authentication, content sharing etc.
* Data retrival from external sources like news feed, weather forcast etc.
* Encourages thrid party developers to build applications, plugins, or extensions on top of existing platforms or services.
* To have better clarity, you can watch this upcoming video by [Code with Harry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiEmCw8n-iU)
* If you haven't linked Flutter with Firebase for authentication service, before proceeding please watch [Video Tutorial for Authentication Setup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWamixHIKmQ)   

# Flutter with Firebase:
* By now we hope you are comfortable with Flutter basics and have a got a brief idea what Firebase does. Combining Flutter with Firebase opens up a world of possibilities for creating powerful, feature-rich, and scalable applications. With Flutter and Firebase, you can seamlessly integrate backend functionalities into your Flutter applications, such as authentication, real-time data synchronization, cloud storage, and much more.
* Upnext we have a youtube playlist in which you will learn how to develop an flutter app integrated with Authentication function by Firebase Auth. This playlist can be considered as your main resource for this week.
