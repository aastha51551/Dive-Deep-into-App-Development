# Week 3
In week 2, we learnt about widgets, OOPS, setting up firebase and designed the frontend of our app . This week, we will cover those topics which will enable us to make real world applications and hence, the backend of our application.

The backend of an app refers to the server-side components that handle the logic, processing, and storage of data for the application. While the frontend focuses on the user interface and user experience, the backend is responsible for managing the server, databases, APIs, and other infrastructure necessary for the app to function.

The following topics will be covered in this week:
<oli>
  
* [API and Flutter with Firebase ](API-and-Flutter-with-Firebase.md)

* [Assignment](Assignment.md)
  
</oli>

<h4>Have fun developing the backend of your app this week!!</h4>
