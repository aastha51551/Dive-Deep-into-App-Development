# Assignment 
In this week, we learnt about object-oriented programming, flutter packages and widgets. This assignment will delve into the basic use of widgets in app development and explore how these components can be leveraged to create engaging and efficient user experiences. 
## App Description
For this week's assignment, you will design a simple **Budget tracker** frontend template. The template has to display a **welcome screen** for the user with **the total budget** available and **category list**. On clicking a category, a new screen must display a list of expenditures and their details. There has to be a **New Expenditure Button** to add new expense and a delete button to delete any expense.

Given below is a sample UI:

## Tasks
* Create a new branch with the name: **RollNumber_IntroToAppDev_Week2(Example: 200040066_IntroToAppDev_Week2)**
* Push your code in the branch you created.
* A Google form will be floated in which you must share the link to the repository and a screen recording of the working application.
