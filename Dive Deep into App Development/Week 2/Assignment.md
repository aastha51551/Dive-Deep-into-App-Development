# Assignment 
In this week, we learnt about object-oriented programming, flutter packages and widgets. This assignment will explore the basic use of widgets in app development and how these components can be leveraged to create engaging and efficient user experiences. 
## App Description
For this week's assignment, you will design a simple **Budget tracker** frontend template. A bare minimum budget tracker app will have the following screens: <br>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Home Screen</strong>: To display user information, expense total and a list of categories.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Expense Screen</strong>: On clicking a category, this screen will display the list of expenses and will have a button to add new expense.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Add Expense Screen/Pop-Up</strong>: With fields to enter expense value, description, etc.
  </li>
</ul>

<em> Note: The data in these screens will be dummy data for now (as demonstrated in [NetNinja Video Tutorial](https://youtu.be/_AC90CiDoKA) ) <em> 

Given below is a sample UI:

## Tasks
* Create a new branch with the name: **RollNumber_IntroToAppDev_Week2(Example: 200040066_IntroToAppDev_Week2)**
* Push your code in the branch you created.
* A Google form will be floated in which you must share the link to the repository and a screen recording of the working application.
