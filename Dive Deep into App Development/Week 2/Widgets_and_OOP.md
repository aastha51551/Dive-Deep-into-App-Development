# Widgets-and-Oops in Flutter


### Widgets
* Widgets are the building blocks of a Flutter app, and understanding how to use them is essential for any Flutter developer. Widgets are UI elements that represent the various components of an app, such as buttons, text, images, and more. Widgets describe what their view should look like given their current configuration and state. We'll learn varoius types of widgets and their applications while we learn basics of flutter.


### Category of Widgets
* Accessibility: These are the set of widgets that make a flutter app more easily accessible.
* Animation and Motion: These widgets add animation to other widgets.
* Assets, Images, and Icons: These widgets take charge of assets such as display images and show icons.
* Async: These provide async functionality in the flutter application.
* Basics: These are the bundle of widgets that are absolutely necessary for the development of any flutter application.
* Cupertino: These are the iOS designed widgets.
* Input: This set of widgets provides input functionality in a flutter application.
* Interaction Models: These widgets are here to manage touch events and route users to different views in the application.
* Layout: This bundle of widgets helps in placing the other widgets on the screen as needed.
* Material Components: This is a set of widgets that mainly follow material design by Google.
* Painting and effects: This is the set of widgets that apply visual changes to their child widgets without changing their layout or shape.
* Scrolling: This provides scrollability of to a set of other widgets that are not scrollable by default.
* Styling: This deals with the theme, responsiveness, and sizing of the app.
* Text: This displays text.

### To have more clarity on widgets you can follow the flutter documentation:
* Go through the [Basic Widgets](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/widgets-intro)
* Going into the depths of building layouts, here are some important topics:
* [Layouts in Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout)
* [Tuorial](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout/tutorial)
* [Understanding constraints](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout/constraints)
* [Box constraints](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/layout/box-constraints)


### Use of Object Oriented Programming in Flutter development
* Data represents the real world. All data describes something real. That's what object-oriented programming is all about: it gives us a nice way to model our data after real-world objects.
* Abstraction: When a programmer builds her class with abstraction in mind, she hides every unnecessary detail from the user. Then, the user can implement more complex logic on top of the provided abstraction without understanding or even thinking about all the hidden complexity. Abstraction focusses on making our code more organized and modularise small parts of code. For example while making a flutter App if you need to use Buttons at various places and you want that each button should be of different colour, it would be really cool if you could just define a custom class for your button with properties such as Button color, Text size, font etc. Now you just need to use your own Button class in your main file. It's like creating your own data type. You can now create your own button and specify its properties very easily.
* Once you learn stateful widgets and Lists, you can proceed learning abstraction which is part of above given plalist by NetNinja:
